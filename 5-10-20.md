Today I learned:

- Composting.  There are several different types:
	- Normal (hot) composting - Uses microbes in soil plus aeration and water.  Becomes hot 120+ and the microbes break it down.  Can be smelly.
	- Bokashi - More common in Japan/Asia.  Uses "bokashi" flakes between layers of compost.  The bacteria essentially ferment the waste making it not very smelly and suitable for indoors.
	- Vermi - Uses worms to break down matter.  Need a little bit of "brown" starter and dirt but otherwise you pour worms (red wriglers) into the container to break it down.  Also doesn't smell.

- To produce bokashi flasks you gather rice wash in a jar and let it ferment for a week to produce lactis bacillus.   Then take the middle layer of fluid and mix it with milk.  After another week or so the milk seperates into curds and whey (this process is also used for making cheese).  Then you take the whey and mix it with molasas or some other sugar to keep it active and mix it with a "brown" medium like wheat husks, newspaper, or saw dust.  The bad needs to sit for 2 weeks and can then be dried to make it last longer.

- The red wrigler worms eat up to their own body-weight per day and are much more effective as composting.  You can buy them online.

- Bio fuel.  Mixing alcohol, sodium hydroxide, and cooking oil produces biodiesel.  You can also substitute potassium hydroxide which is lye water.  This is produced from hardwook ash.  It seperates into the fuel and glycerin.  Without the alcohol a similar mixute is used to make soap.
