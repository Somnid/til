Today I learned:

- Tensorflow js has multiple backends.  It's getting harder to correctly setup.  But you can choose from JS, CPU (node), GPU (with cuda), WebGL (browser) and WASM, and NodeGL and WebGPU are under development.
- Tensorflow has some built in stuff for word embeddings.
- Can't be used from deno as-is because of node-style imports, would need a mapping.  Deno can use importmaps but they are unstable.

- A fuse is just a weak piece of filament that burns out when too much current passes through to prevent damage.  Rather cheap to buy and come in a few different types, tube (common in electronics) and automotive which are flat.
