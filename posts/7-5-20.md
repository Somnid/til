Today I learned:

- Beaker hyperdrives are kinda like git repos.  They keep a simple change log and encompass multiple files and folders.
- In order to make a social network with beaker, the most common scenario is that each person owns their own posts in a folder dedicated to the app. The app then stitches contacts' posts together.  It's not clear to me yet how one might create a network with anonymous users.
