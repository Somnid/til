Today I learned:

- If you hit the HSTS error page in chrome, despite not having an "I know what I'm doing" button, you can type "thisisunsafe" to bypass the page.

- Ram pumps are pumps that use two values.  The first value is manually opened and pulls liquid into a chamber, the pressure increase then closes it and pushes out a second valve.  The second value closes when pressure decreases and the first opens again in a cyclic manner.  In this way the water flow itself can pump the water without any electricity required.
