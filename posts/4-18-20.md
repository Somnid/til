Today I learned:

- There exists ultrasonic rangers for Arduino: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ANFN5GM.  An existing project uses it to measure rise of sourdough which is interesting (https://www.twilio.com/blog/how-to-data-tracker-sourdough-starter?utm_campaign=sourdio-site&utm_medium=site&utm_source=sourdio).  Amazon also has a LiDAR sensor which I guess is a more accurate version of the same thing?

- Modules are just another type of environment when implementing programing langauges. https://github.com/Somnid/eva/blob/master/js/lib/eva.js#L165
